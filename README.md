# rushProject
## DUE SEPTEMBER 8TH
Hello, if you are reading this, then that must mean you're either a computer science major or you're interested in programming. Congrats on being cool. 

Anyways, this is a intended to be a small project for now to help make deliberation go a little bit smoother, but also keep track of who makes it through the program.

This project as of August 27th, 2018 is using React-Redux as the front end, with a fake database within the file. 
In order to be to edit the project, please install Nodejs and npm, then clone the repository to your local.

Travel to the location in which you cloned the repository. 
git checkout v1, to checkout to the intial state of the project. 
Next to start the scripts, use 'npm start'. 

This should load the project and the first version of it in which myself, Brandon Pacheco, and my brother/colleague/bestest friend Benjamin Ladick started on.

By the time you see this there should hopefully be more versions and you can travel through branches to see the differences of what we and the fraternity suggested to make this project better.
